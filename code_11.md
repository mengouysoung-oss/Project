# 🔐 Cryptography Educational Tool

A comprehensive educational tool for learning different cryptography algorithms and techniques.

## Features

### 1. Caesar Cipher
- Classic substitution cipher
- Shifts each letter by a fixed number
- Supports both encryption and decryption
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters

### 2. General Shift Cipher
- Extended version of Caesar cipher
- Works with any ASCII character set
- Supports any shift value
- Useful for understanding basic cryptographic concepts

### 3. Affine Cipher
- Mathematical formula-based: E(x) = (ax + b) mod 26
- Requires two keys (a and b)
- Key 'a' must be coprime with 26
- More secure than Caesar cipher

### 4. Transposition Cipher
- Rearranges characters based on keyword
- Uses alphabetical ordering of keyword
- Good for understanding character rearrangement concepts
- No key length restrictions

### 5. RSA Cryptography
- Public-key cryptosystem
- Key generation from two prime numbers
- Educational implementation with small numbers
- Demonstrates modern encryption concepts
